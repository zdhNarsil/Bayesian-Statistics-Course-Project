# Bayesian-Statistics-Course-Project
The project for *Bayesian Statistics* (2019 Spring PKU) by Dinghuai Zhang, Jiaqi Zhang and Feng Zhu.

This project mainly focus on *online* multi-classification problem under *multinomial logit* model. We tackle this problem via *Thompson Sampling*, a bayesian meta-algorithm for contextual bandits problem.  We develop two ways, guassian approximation and Polya-Gamma methods (PG-TS). Details can be seen in our `report.pdf`. Besides, a simple demo of Thompson Sampling can be found in `Code/bernouli_bandit.ipynb`.

The code of approximation method can be found in `Code/Approximation`, while that of PG-TS is available in `Code/PG-TS` and `Code/PGSampler`. The real dataset file can be found in `Dataset`.
